    "I had been Solving a Project Euler problem https://projecteuler.net/problem=49 (details to be given later). During that project I was looking at the 'deltas' between primes and their relationships. I started thinking about primes and wondered how that delta shifted over time as well as the density of primes changes as n increases. Let's plot the number of primes per a unit. In this case I choose 1000. \n"
